# Advent of Code 2020

Hi, these are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
As I started, I simply solved the tasks quick and dirty, but tried to explain more the later it became.

The raw files start with 00 for the first day. The input txt files are the input files generated for me.
Sometimes you will see 2 files per day for each part, sometimes there are both solutions in one file.
