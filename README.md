# Advent of Code 2020
Hi, these are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
As I started, I simply solved the tasks quick and dirty, but tried to explain more the later it became.

I add a folder *AdventOfCodeSolutions* where I will start explaining what I did and comment the code for you (and future me) to understand what i did. 
I will also enhance or rewrite the code if necessary or possible.

The raw files start with 00 for the first day. The input txt files are the input files generated for me.
Sometimes you will see 2 files per day for each part, sometimes there are both solutions in one file.

### Raw Solutions Current State: Day 8
### Explained Solutions Current State: -


Feel free to ask me if you want to know anything about my solutions.
